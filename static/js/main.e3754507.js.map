I use resources like Human Rights Campaign's <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/glossary-of-terms\">Glossary of Terms</a> to explain terms that I don't personally identify with – but lists like that are limited. They only include so many words, and for each term they just give an impersonal dictionary definition.</p>\n\n            <p>These words have a lot of nuance and depth. For example, two people who identify as bisexual might have completely different explanations of what that word means to them. That's why I'm gathering informal definitions from LGBTQ+ people – to give multiple personal perspectives. That way people learning these words can get more of the full story, and if they're looking for a way to label themself they can find something they connect to.</p>\n\n            <h6 className=\"_2J-aP\" style={{marginTop: \"16px\"}}>About Me</h6>\n            <p>I'm a senior at Tufts University studying Gender Studies and Computer Science.

As a pansexual person, I usually don't find myself to be attracted to a specific person because of their body (unlike a lot of guys I've seen at my school). It's more of a personality thing with me, even though I know that many people care a lot about how a person looks.
